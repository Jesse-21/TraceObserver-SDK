## üß¨ TraceObserver SDK DEMO

Zero-Trust. Infinite Signal.

**The universal passive behavioral fingerprinting + risk scoring engine for Web3**

Used by Unmask Protocol and RugDox to protect Web3 users by capturing invisible behavioral entropy.

## What Is It?

`TraceObserver` is a client-side JavaScript SDK that generates a cryptographically hashed fingerprint of a user's session by analyzing:

- Interaction entropy (mouse movement, focus, scroll)
- Wallet method timings
- Memory usage patterns
- Session duration and behavioral rhythms

It works entirely on the client, streams via CDN, and supports any Web3 app or frontend. Submissions are sent to any server endpoint you define.



## Perfect for:
- Fraud detection
- Risk scoring
- Account security & recovery
- Web3 identity fingerprinting
- Cross-wallet behavior linking
- Rug pull forensics (Unmask Protocol compatible)



# What It Captures

## Signal Type ---> Details:
-  RPC Trace Timing	    --->   Method-by-method latency fingerprint during wallet operations
-  Focus/Blur Entropy	  --->   Wallet popup behavior, user reflex pattern
-  Memory Signature	    --->   JS heap usage deltas hinting at browser/device load
-  User Input Rhythm    --->	 Mouse movement, scroll, keyboard cadence
-  Session Duration     --->   total interaction time
-  Wallet Patterning	  --->   Tracks gas estimate retries, signing flow behavior
-  SHA-256 Fingerprint  --->   Final hash digest of entire interaction
-  Basic Risk Analysis  --->   Output from custom scoring (optional)



## SDK Methods

- `init(config)` ‚Äì Starts SDK with runtime config
- `setScorer(fn)` ‚Äì Inject custom scoring function
- `finalize()` ‚Äì Builds and returns trace object
- `submit(endpoint?)` ‚Äì Submits to endpoint
- `export()` ‚Äì Returns trace data locally



## Security Notes

- No PII is collected
- Passive by default (submission requires `submit()`)
- Fully client-side and CDN compatible



# What You Get

- ‚úÖ Fully client-side, browser-native SDK
- ‚úÖ No dependencies, ultra-lightweight
- ‚úÖ Works with all EVM wallets, especially MetaMask
- ‚úÖ Built for CDN delivery (can host via Vercel/Cloudflare)
- ‚úÖ Plug in your own scoring, AI, or rules engine
- ‚úÖ export() method for offline trace analysis
- ‚úÖ Use in wallets, platforms, NFTs, bridges, DeFi, anything



# Why It Matters

Web3 needs more than signatures ‚Äî it needs evidence of presence.

TraceObserver turns the invisible into immutable evidence:
- Catch bot-driven airdrop abuse
- Prevent identity cloaking during RugID issuance
- Detect rug-pull operations in progress
- Link malicious actors across wallets and browsers
- De-anonymize repeated wallet factory spammers



**Built for the Next Generation of Web3 Forensics**

# This SDK powers:
- Web3DNA Global Identity Engine
- Unmask Protocol for founder accountability
- RugDox Risk Scoring & Verification Systems



# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The **TraceObserver SDK** passively collects behavioral signals and session entropy from users interacting with your site or dApp. It generates a cryptographic fingerprint (Web3DNA) that can be submitted to your backend, stored, or used in real-time risk scoring.



üõ†Ô∏è 1. Load the SDK

Load via CDN or serve statically:

```
<script src="https://cdn.yourdomain.com/trace-observer.sdk.js"></script>
```



‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Initialize the SDK

```
TraceObserver.init({
  platform_id: "UNMASK_PROTOCOL",                         // Your project or app name
  wallet: "0x123...abc",                                   // Optional wallet ID
  submitEndpoint: "https://your-api.com/trace/submit",    // Where to send trace data
  captureUserInput: true,                                 // Track clicks, movement, scrolls
  enableFocusEvents: true,                                // Detect alt-tab or popup focus
  enableMemorySampling: true,                             // Monitor memory usage
  debug: true                                              // Console logs for debugging
});
```


‚∏ª

üß† 3. (Optional) Add a Custom Scoring Engine

```
TraceObserver.setScorer(trace => {
  let score = 0;
  if (trace.rpcTimeline.length > 10) score += 20;
  if (trace.userActions.length < 3) score += 40;
  return { score, flagged: score > 40 };
});
```

This lets you define what risky or suspicious behavior looks like for your system.



üì§ 4. Submit the Trace

```
const result = await TraceObserver.submit();
```
This packages the trace, hashes the session data, adds your risk score, and sends it to the configured endpoint.



üì¶ Optional: Export Without Submitting

```
const localTrace = TraceObserver.export();
```
Use this if you want to inspect or store the trace locally or feed it into another system.



# Dev Notes
- Framework agnostic
- ES module & IIFE versions supported
- Extendable with WebGL, audio, canvas, timezone, font entropy
- Compatible with federated learning / AI modeling systems


#  Vision

Fingerprinting isn‚Äôt about watching ‚Äî it‚Äôs about witnessing.

When the scam hits, you‚Äôll know who, how, and what led to it.

TraceObserver is your silent watcher in a trustless world.
