## 🧬 TraceObserver SDK DEMO

Zero-Trust. Infinite Signal.

**The universal passive behavioral fingerprinting + risk scoring engine for Web3**

Used by Unmask Protocol and RugDox to protect Web3 users by capturing invisible behavioral entropy.

[ Vercel Hosted Demo:  https://trace-observer-sdk.vercel.app ]

## What Is It?

`TraceObserver` is a client-side JavaScript SDK that generates a cryptographically hashed fingerprint of a user's session by analyzing:

- Interaction entropy (mouse movement, focus, scroll)
- Wallet method timings
- Memory usage patterns
- Session duration and behavioral rhythms

It works entirely on the client, streams via CDN, and supports any Web3 app or frontend. Submissions are sent to any server endpoint you define.

---

Perfect for:
- Fraud detection
- Risk scoring
- Account security & recovery
- Web3 identity fingerprinting
- Cross-wallet behavior linking
- Rug pull forensics (Unmask Protocol compatible)

# What It Captures

Signal Type	Details:
-  RPC Trace Timing	    --->   Method-by-method latency fingerprint during wallet operations
-  Focus/Blur Entropy	  --->   Wallet popup behavior, user reflex pattern
-  Memory Signature	    --->   JS heap usage deltas hinting at browser/device load
-  User Input Rhythm    --->	 Mouse movement, scroll, keyboard cadence
-  Session Duration     --->   total interaction time
-  Wallet Patterning	  --->   Tracks gas estimate retries, signing flow behavior
-  SHA-256 Fingerprint  --->   Final hash digest of entire interaction
-  Basic Risk Analysis  --->   Output from custom scoring (optional)

---

## 💾 SDK Methods

- `init(config)` – Starts SDK with runtime config
- `setScorer(fn)` – Inject custom scoring function
- `finalize()` – Builds and returns trace object
- `submit(endpoint?)` – Submits to endpoint
- `export()` – Returns trace data locally

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- No PII is collected
- Passive by default (submission requires `submit()`)
- Fully client-side and CDN compatible

---

# 🧠 Why It Matters

Web3 needs more than signatures — it needs evidence of presence.

TraceObserver turns the invisible into immutable evidence:
- 	•	Catch bot-driven airdrop abuse
- 	•	Prevent identity cloaking during RugID issuance
- 	•	Detect rug-pull operations in progress
- 	•	Link malicious actors across wallets and browsers
- 	•	De-anonymize repeated wallet factory spammers

**Built for the Next Generation of Web3 Forensics**

# This SDK powers:
- Web3DNA Global Identity Engine
- Unmask Protocol for founder accountability
- RugDox Risk Scoring & Verification Systems

# 💥 Get Started

Clone, serve, or CDN:

<script src="https:// <URL-Of-Your-Chosen-SDK-Source> /trace-observer.sdk.js"></script>

You must pass submitEndpoint via .init() or .submit(endpoint)

Remember:
	•	If you’re streaming the SDK via a CDN this config is passed client-side only
	•	The submitEndpoint can be:
	•	A webhook (e.g. Webhook.site)
	•	Your real backend (e.g. https://api.your-server.url/trace/submit)
	•	A proxy server that logs or inspects the fingerprint


EXAMPLE:

<script src="https://cdn.your-site-url.com/trace-observer.sdk.js"></script>
<script>
  TraceObserver.init({
    platform_id: "UNMASK_PLATFORM",
    wallet: "0x123...abc",  // optional: for RugID linkage
    submitEndpoint: "https://api.unmask-server/trace/submit", // ✅ required for sending
    captureUserInput: true,
    enableFocusEvents: true,
    enableMemorySampling: true,
    debug: true
  });

  // Optional: plug in your own scoring function
  TraceObserver.setScorer(trace => {
    let risk = 0;
    if (trace.rpcTimeline.length > 10) risk += 20;
    if (trace.userActions.length < 3) risk += 40;
    return { score: risk, flagged: risk > 40 };
  });

  // Later, after a wallet interaction or on button click:
  async function sendTrace() {
    const result = await TraceObserver.submit();
    console.log('Trace submitted:', result);
  }
</script>

-  	•	ES module & IIFE versions supported
- 	•	Extendable with WebGL, audio, canvas, timezone, font entropy
- 	•	Compatible with federated learning / AI modeling systems

#  Vision

Fingerprinting isn’t about watching — it’s about witnessing.

When the scam hits, you’ll know who, how, and what led to it.

TraceObserver is your silent watcher in a trustless world.
